# STRING LIBRARY

This is a series of functions that help with common operations on strings. The functions include the following:

* **toTitleCase**: This will process a string and will capitalise the first letter of each word but will make all the other letters lowercase.
* **countWords**: This will count the number of separate words within a string. Words are delimited by spaces, commas, dashes, or underscores.
* **toWords**: This will return all the words that are within a string. Words are delimited by spaces, dashes, or underscores.
* **repeat**: This will take a string and a number and return the same string repeated that number of times.
* **isAlpha**: This will return true if the string only has alpha characters.
* **isBlank**: This will return true if the string is blank, that is, consists only of whitespace characters.
* **joinArrs**: This will join each element in one array with the corresponding element in the other array.
